To develop an extension which  can show how much amount of co2 will be released due to uploading a particular  size of image in cloud and also help the user to reduce the size of image and show the user how much amount of co2 release is cut down by resizing the image.

If Image size was 1MB.

Now, let's do the calculation:
 
Energy Consumption = 1 MB of 2% of 0.475 kg CO2/kWh
 The 2% accounts for the data center's share of global electricity consumption.

Energy Consumption of Servers: 2% of global electricity consumption.- Carbon Intensity: 0.475 kg CO2 per kWh. 

Now, let's calculate the energy consumption and CO2 emissions for storing 1 MB of image data in the cloud for 1 year: 

Energy Consumption = 1 MB * 2% = 0.02 MB of global electricity consumption.
and we want to find the CO2 emissions for storing 0.02 MB of data: CO2 Emissions = Energy Consumption * Carbon IntensityCO2 Emissions = 0.02 MB * 0.475 kg CO2/kWh CO2 Emissions = 0.0095 kg CO2

Since we know the carbon intensity is 0.475 kg CO2 per kWh, and 

we want to find the CO2 emissions for storing 0.02 MB of data: CO2 Emissions = Energy Consumption * 

Carbon IntensityCO2 Emissions = 0.02 MB * 0.475 kg  CO2/kWh CO2

Emissions = 9.5 g CO2
